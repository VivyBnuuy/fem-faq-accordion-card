Hi! Welcome to the repository for my solution to this <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/faq-accordion-card-XlyjD0Oam" target="_blank">Frontend Mentor challenge</a>!

# Summary
Second JavaScript project! This one was simpler, but similar to the first project I uploaded here so it was more about solidifying what I learned on the first one. The design was more challenging to be honest, so it was good practice for CSS ðŸ˜Š

For this challenge, I used the following: 
- CSS Grid
- Sass/SCSS
- BEM
- JavaScript

# Looking Back
- Not sure if I used the best way to position the images on the desktop layout. This works, but there might've been a better solution for them.
- As mentioned above, this ended up being more of a CSS challenge than it was for JavaScript - I used similar code as what I wrote on <a href="https://github.com/LazyDuckling/fem-intro-component-signup-form" target="_blank">this project</a>. I did play around with a couple different ways for the chevrons on the questions, however - I tried background images, :after selector element and ended up going with images, as that was the easiest to manipulate with JavaScript.

# The End
Thanks for checking out my solution to this challenge! If you have any feedback, I would love if you reached out to me or opened an issue if there's anything that needs fixing; I'm always looking to improve!

Happy coding!
